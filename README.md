# 🏥 Hospital Claims Processing System – Backend Microservice

This project is a backend-only **Hospital Claims Processing System** developed using **Java 8 + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL**. It simulates real-world hospital workflows such as managing patient records, processing insurance claims, and enforcing approval rules.

All endpoints are tested via **Postman**, and the project is structured for scalability, security, and ease of integration with future frontend systems.

## 📜 Business Rules

- A claim must be tied to a valid and active patient
- Claims over a certain threshold (e.g. ₹10,000) may require manual review
- Future scope: Use Spring Security to restrict claim approval to specific roles

---

## 🧪 Postman Testing

- All endpoints are tested via **Postman**
- A `hospital-claims.postman_collection.json` file is available in the repo (if uploaded)
- Supports CRUD flows for patients and claims
